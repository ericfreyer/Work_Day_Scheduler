In this homework assignment I created a day planner. When the planner opens the current date and time is displayed. Using the "Luxon" API, I created an object that tracks the time and changes the color of the hour blocks depending on whether it's in the past, present, or future. The present time-block will be colored in red, the past will be in grey, and the future in green. These should update in realtime. Another feature is the save button. After the user inputs something in the time-block, they can click the save button to the right. This should store their text in local storage so it can be called when the page is reloaded later on in the day.
